/*
 * Build this tree twice; the two `dist/` outputs must be byte-identical.
 *
 * This is the proof the published-payload parity gate (R3-755) rests on. The SDK
 * publishes BUILT `dist` — the tarball's `files` is `["dist"]` — so comparing the
 * packed payload against the published package is only sound if the build is a pure
 * function of the source tree: same input, same bytes. If the build embedded
 * timestamps, absolute paths, or unordered iteration, every pair of builds would
 * differ, a payload gate would be red forever, and the honest gate would decay into
 * a downgraded one nobody reads. Measured here, not assumed: the check runs the real
 * `npm run build` twice and byte-compares the whole output, naming any file whose
 * digest moved.
 *
 * ## What counts as a difference
 *
 * Any file present on one side and not the other, or present on both with different
 * SHA-256 digests. Nothing is ignored: no mtime window, no normalized line endings,
 * no allowlist. A file that genuinely varies per build (a generated timestamp
 * header) is a BUILD bug to fix, not noise to filter — that is the invariant the
 * payload gate needs.
 *
 * ## Where it runs
 *
 * `verify` (through `check:reproducible`, after `npm run build` — it needs
 * `node_modules`) and the CI build's enumerated steps, after the build step. Two
 * full builds per run is the price of the proof; the SDK build is tens of seconds.
 *
 * Usage: node scripts/check-build-reproducible.mjs [--self-test]
 * Exit:  0 the two builds are byte-identical (or --self-test passed)
 *        1 the two builds differ — the differing paths are named; fix the build
 *        2 a build itself failed
