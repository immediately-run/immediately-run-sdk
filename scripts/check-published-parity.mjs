/*
 * If this version is ALREADY on npm, what we would publish must declare the same
 * install surface as what IS published.
 *
 * `ci.yml`'s publish step skips when `package.json`'s version already exists, and says so
 * with a `::notice::` — not a failure. That skip is correct (a re-run of an old commit
 * must not try to republish) and it is also how `main` and the published package drifted
 * apart for weeks without a single red build in a consumer repo (grove): an SDK pin moved
 * from `^0.52.0` to `^0.65.0` on `main`, the version was never bumped, so the published
 * package kept declaring the old pin. Every consumer installing it got the OLD pin, npm
 * nested a second copy, and R3-556 — which composes that package — was blocked by it with
 * nothing anywhere reporting a problem.
 *
 * The invariant this restores: a skip is benign only when it is a NO-OP. Same version,
 * different declarations, means the version number is a lie and the fix is to bump it.
 *
 * ## The payload half — closed here by R3-755, after the determinism proof
 *
 * grove's copy of this script (`immediately-run/grove`,
 * `scripts/check-published-parity.mjs`) compares the per-entry packed payload
 * (R3-751), closing the second half of the hole: a change under an already-published
 * version with an unchanged manifest still passed this comparison and let the publish
 * step skip silently. This script now does the same — the port R3-755 owns. It could
 * not be copied blind: the SDK publishes built `dist`, so a payload compare is only
 * sound if the build is reproducible (same input tree, same output bytes), and that
 * is PROVEN first by `scripts/check-build-reproducible.mjs` (two builds of one tree,
 * byte-identical), which runs beside this check in `verify` and CI. The payload
 * compare needs a built `dist/`: without one it is the cannot-answer case (exit 2;
 * `--offline-ok` downgrades it like an unreadable registry — a line says the
 * comparison never ran), never a pass that looks like parity.
 *
 * CLOSED EVERYWHERE, named so it cannot read as org-wide closure by silence:
 * the two further manifest-only copies this header used to carry as STILL OPEN
 * were closed by R3-756 — `immediately-run-cli`
 * (`scripts/check-published-parity.mjs`, since R3-640) and this repo's own
 * `safe-content/` package (whose release branch invokes its copy strictly,
 * ci.yml's safe-content job), each with its own determinism proof first
 * (`check-build-reproducible.mjs` in each package). Four copies, four closures:
 * grove (R3-751), sdk root (R3-755), cli (R3-756), safe-content (R3-756).
 *
 * ## What is compared, and what cannot be
 *
 * The dependency blocks, plus `main` and `exports`: the parts of the manifest a
 * consumer's install and resolution actually read, so a difference there changes what is
 * on a consumer's disk or which file they get when they import. `devDependencies` is
 * excluded because it is never on a consumer's disk. `files` is excluded from the
 * MANIFEST comparison because npm does not keep it in the packument — but the payload
 * itself is compared since R3-755: per-entry content digests of `npm pack` on both
 * sides, `package.json` included, when the version is already published and the
 * manifest is at parity. Tarball bytes are never compared — gzip framing, mtimes,
 * uid/gid and mode differ on every pack of identical content; the file contents are
 * exact.
 *
 * ## Where it runs, and why in more than one place
 *
 * `verify` (through `check:published`) and the PR build's enumerated steps — the early
 * call before `npm ci` can only compare the manifest (no build exists yet; the payload
 * half says so rather than passing silently), and the call after `npm run build`
 * compares both. The release job's already-published branch runs it strictly (no
 * `--offline-ok`): a drift there means the release about to be skipped would silently
 * no-op. A version not yet published is the ordinary state everywhere — exit 0, nothing
 * to compare.
 *
 * Usage: node scripts/check-published-parity.mjs [--self-test] [--offline-ok]
 * Exit:  0 parity (manifest and, when a built dist exists, payload), or this version
 *        is not published yet (nothing to compare)
 *        1 drift — same version, different manifest declarations or a different
 *        packed payload
 *        2 cannot answer (registry unreadable, offline, malformed reply; or the
 *        payload comparison could not run — no built dist)
 *          …unless --offline-ok, which downgrades ONLY that case to 0.
