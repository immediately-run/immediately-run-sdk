/*
 * If this version is ALREADY on npm, what we would publish must declare the same
 * install surface as what IS published.
 *
 * `ci.yml`'s publish step skips when `package.json`'s version already exists, and says so
 * with a `::notice::` — not a failure. That skip is correct (a re-run of an old commit
 * must not try to republish) and it is also how `main` and the published package drifted
 * apart for weeks without a single red build in a consumer repo (grove): an SDK pin moved
 * from `^0.52.0` to `^0.65.0` on `main`, the version was never bumped, so the published
 * package kept declaring the old pin. Every consumer installing it got the OLD pin, npm
 * nested a second copy, and R3-556 — which composes that package — was blocked by it with
 * nothing anywhere reporting a problem.
 *
 * The invariant this restores: a skip is benign only when it is a NO-OP. Same version,
 * different declarations, means the version number is a lie and the fix is to bump it.
 *
 * ## The payload half is open here, and being closed in grove
 *
 * grove's copy of this script (`immediately-run/grove`,
 * `scripts/check-published-parity.mjs`) gains a per-entry packed-payload compare
 * (R3-751, carried by immediately-run/grove#74 — under review as this pointer lands),
 * closing the second half of the hole: a change under an already-published version with
 * an unchanged manifest still passed this comparison and let the publish step skip
 * silently. The port is not copied here blind: the SDK publishes built `dist`, so a
 * payload compare is only sound once this repo's build is shown to be reproducible.
 * Roadmap item R3-755 owns the port, with build determinism as its first deliverable —
 * do not add a payload compare to this script before that proof exists. Merge order:
 * grove#74 first, so main nowhere describes a gate its code does not have.
 *
 * ## What is compared, and what cannot be
 *
 * The dependency blocks, plus `main` and `exports`: the parts of the manifest a
 * consumer's install and resolution actually read, so a difference there changes what is
 * on a consumer's disk or which file they get when they import. `devDependencies` is
 * excluded because it is never on a consumer's disk. `files` is excluded because it
 * CANNOT be compared — npm does not keep it in the packument, so the registry has no
 * answer to compare against. Comparing whole tarballs would fail on every timestamp and
 * prove nothing.
 *
 * ## Where it runs, and why in two places
 *
 * `verify` (through `check:published`), where it catches a pin that moves without a
 * version bump ON THE PULL REQUEST that does it — which is the only moment the fix is one
 * line. A version not yet published is the ordinary state there, so that is exit 0, not a
 * failure. And again in the publish job, where a drift means the release about to be
 * skipped would silently no-op.
 *
 * Usage: node scripts/check-published-parity.mjs [--self-test] [--offline-ok]
 * Exit:  0 parity, or this version is not published yet (nothing to compare)
 *        1 drift — same version, different declarations
 *        2 cannot answer (registry unreadable, offline, malformed reply)
 *          …unless --offline-ok, which downgrades ONLY that case to 0.

 *  - **unreadable** — no network, a private-registry auth failure, a malformed reply.
 *    Never a pass on its own: the publish job only reaches this once `npm view` has
 *    already said the version EXISTS, so failing to read it there is a real problem.
 *  - **published** — a JSON object of the requested fields. EMPTY stdout is this case
 *    too, and means a manifest declaring none of them.
