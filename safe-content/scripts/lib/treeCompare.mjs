// Shared tree-compare core for the release gates: the published-payload parity
// check (`check-published-parity.mjs`) and the build-determinism check
// (`check-build-reproducible.mjs`) are the same comparison — two trees, per-entry
// content digests, differences as rows — over different subjects (published
// tarball vs rebuilt dist). One home (R6); each gate keeps only its own subject
// and its own exit-code policy.
//
// Vendored from this repo's own `scripts/lib/treeCompare.mjs` (R3-755): the SDK
// root and safe-content are separate packages with separate installs, so the
// sibling file is not importable from here. If the core ever changes, change
// every copy in the same wave — the copies are this file, the SDK root's
// `scripts/lib/treeCompare.mjs`, and the CLI's vendored
// `immediately-run-cli/scripts/lib/treeCompare.mjs` (grove's parity script
// predates the extraction and keeps its own inline digest walk, so it is not a
// copy); verify a copy's code by diffing below the header, not by whole-file
// hash.
//
// Row fields are named first/second: the reproducible check compares two builds
// of the same tree and neither side is "published"; the parity check maps them
// onto its published/local vocabulary in its own wrapper.
