// Provider-agnostic agentic tool-use loop — PORTED from agent-demo `src/lib/agentLoop.ts`
// (GROVE_AGENT_SPEC §7: embedded agents REUSE this seam rather than reimplementing it;
// the SDK is its shared home so every app's agent loop is the same exercised machinery).
// Renames for the SDK's flat export surface: `ChatMessage`→`AgentMessage`, `Role`→`AgentRole`.
// Provider-agnostic agentic tool-use loop (LLM_AND_AGENTS_SPEC §3.3). The loop is
// the heart of the in-browser coding agent: send the conversation + tool list to a
// ModelClient, execute any tool calls the model emits, append the results, and
// repeat until the model stops, a spend budget is hit, or a large safety-stop is
// reached. The ModelClient seam keeps the loop independent of any one provider
// (host `chat()` impl: chatModelClient.ts).
//
// Confinement (G12/T24) is NOT enforced here — it falls out of the capability
// model: the `tools` handed to the model ARE the app's grant-filtered §5.5
// catalog (agentTools.ts), and `execute` routes through the host's gated
// `invoke()`, so an off-catalog/hallucinated tool returns `forbidden` at the host.
//
// R3-220 (AHG-1) adds the machinery that lets the loop run LONG enough to build a
// real app: token accounting (from the provider `usage` delta), automatic context
// COMPACTION when the window fills, a truncated-tool-call guard, and a spend budget
// replacing the old fixed 12-turn cap. All of it is inert unless a `contextWindow`
// is supplied, so a caller that passes none behaves exactly as before.
//
// PREFIX STABILITY IS LOAD-BEARING (R3-336). The loop's contribution to prompt caching
// is structural, not a parameter: `system` and `tools` are fixed for a run and are sent
// BYTE-IDENTICALLY on every turn, while everything that changes is appended to
// `messages`. That is what the host's cache breakpoints key on. Rebuilding the system
// prompt per turn — re-stamping a date, re-ordering the tool list — would cost nothing
// visible and silently turn every cache read into a cache write, so it is asserted in
// the tests rather than left as a convention.
